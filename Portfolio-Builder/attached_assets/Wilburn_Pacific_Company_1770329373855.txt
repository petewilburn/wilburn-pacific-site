About
Who we are
Wilburn Pacific Company is an engineering-led industrial contractor specializing in overhead crane systems and heavy rigging. Unlike standard fabricators, we lead with mechanical engineering principles to solve complex load handling problems.

Our mission
To deliver lifting solutions that are structurally sound, operationally precise, and compliant with ASME B30 and CMAA 70 standards.

History & milestones
2008 — Founded to provide specialized structural fabrication.
2014 — Expanded into heavy rigging and crane runway surveys.
2019 — Established in-house engineering department for custom below-the-hook lifters.
2023 — Awarded regional contract for port crane modernization.

Leadership
Principal Engineer: Pete Wilburn — Mechanical Engineer with 15+ years of experience in heavy machinery design and structural analysis.
Operations Manager: Maria Lopez — Certified welding inspector and project manager specializing in critical path shutdowns.

Certifications
Professional Engineering (PE) Licensure
AWS D1.1 / D14.1 Welding Certifications
OSHA 1910.179 Compliance Specialists

Services
Overview
We bridge the gap between theoretical engineering and practical fabrication. Every project begins with a structural assessment and ends with a load test.

Service lines

4. Installation & Commissioning — Safe erection followed by 125% rated load testing.

Projects
Case Study: Riverport Crane Retrofit
Location: Riverport Industrial Park, WA
Challenge: An aging 50-ton bridge crane suffered from fatigue cracks and obsolete contactor controls.
Engineering Solution: Conducted FEA to identify stress concentrations. Installed cover plates to reinforce the girder and replaced controls with a Magnetek VFD system.
Outcome: Zero safety incidents; improved positioning accuracy by 200%; extended crane life by 15 years.
Photos: FEA stress map, control panel wiring, load testing.

Case Study: Mill #4 Custom Gantry
Location: Inland Paper Mill, OR
Challenge: Client needed to lift 20-ton rolls in a facility with only 18 feet of headroom.
Engineering Solution: Designed a custom low-profile double-girder gantry with a nested hoist trolley to maximize hook height.
Outcome: Achieved required lift height with 6 inches of clearance; reduced load cycle time by 40%.
Key Metrics: 1.5x safety factor on all structural members; L/600 deflection criteria met.

FAQ
Do you perform load testing? — Yes. We perform certified static and dynamic load tests up to 125% of rated capacity.
Can you upgrade existing cranes? — Yes. We specialize in retrofitting older DC or contactor-controlled cranes with modern AC VFD systems.
What design standards do you use? — All designs adhere to CMAA 70 (Specifications for Top Running Bridge & Gantry Type Multiple Girder Electric Overhead Traveling Cranes) and ASME B30 standards.

Technical notes
We utilize SolidWorks for 3D modeling and RISA-3D for structural analysis. All welding procedures comply with AWS D14.1 (Specification for Welding of Industrial and Mill Cranes).
